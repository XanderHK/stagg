## Asset Library

Currently a work-in-progress, the goal of this library is to offer standardized models and comprehensive details for all in-game assets including maps, modes, weapons, killstreaks, and more.

## Getting Started

Install the package:

```
# Using npm
npm i @callofduty/assets
```

```
# Using yarn
yarn add @callofduty/assets
```

After installation is complete, you will have access to the Asset library.

```ts
import { Assets } from '@callofduty/assets'
```
